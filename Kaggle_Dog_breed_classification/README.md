Dataset Link: [Competition_link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data) 

### Problem Statement 
The classifier should only predict scores for these breeds : beagle, chihuahua, doberman,
french_bulldog, golden_retriever, malamute, pug, saint_bernard, scottish_deerhound,
tibetan_mastiff.
1. Any of these frameworks can be used : Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, Caffee.
2. The classifier should only be built using Resnet50 CNN architecture.
3. Evaluation metrics i.e Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, F1 Score, ROC-AUC Score shall be calculated
on test data


### Future Imporvements 
1. Displaying ROC-AUC curve
2. Trying Different transfer learning models
